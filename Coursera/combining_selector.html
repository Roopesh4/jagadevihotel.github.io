        <p>So far we have looked at how to use different types of selectors individually, but we also need to know how to use these
        selectors together. By combining selectors we can be more specific about which element or group of elements weâ€™d like to
        select.</p>
        <p class="mustard">For example, say we want to select all paragraph elements that reside within an element with a class attribute value of
        hotdog and set their background color to brown. However, if one of those paragraphs happens to have the class attribute
        value of mustard, we want to set its background color to yellow. Our HTML and CSS may look like the following:</p>
    </div>
    
    <!--Layering styles with multiple clases-->
    <p class="btn btn-danger">One way to keep the specificity weights of our selectors low is to be as modular as possible, sharing similar styles
    from element to element. And one way to be as modular as possible is to layer on different styles by using multiple
    classes</p>
    <p class="btn btn-success">Elements within HTML can have more than one class attribute value so long as each value is space separated. With that,
    we can place certain styles on all elements of one sort while placing other styles only on specific elements of that
    sort.</p>
